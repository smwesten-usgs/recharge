\title{Baseflow Separation}
\usage{
bfi(date, discharge, by = "water year", f = 0.9, N = 5L,
  STAID = "Unknown")
}
\arguments{
\item{date}{the date for each \code{discharge} value, should be of class "Date." Missing values
are not permitted.}

\item{discharge}{the daily streamflow to be separated missing values are not permitted
within the time specified by \code{Start} and \code{end}.}

\item{by}{string describing how to construct turning points: "water year", "calendar_year", or
"continuous".}

\item{f}{the factor for identifying turning points.}

\item{N}{the time perod for period for calculating the turning points.}

\item{STAID}{the station identifier for the data.}
}
\value{
an object of class "baseflow" and inherits class "data.frame" of the selected data, a data
frame of the baseflow information, and other information about the analysis.
}
\description{
Extract baseflow from a daily streamflow record using the method proposed by
the Institute of Hydrology (1980a,b), and as implemented by Wahl and Wahl (1988).
}
\details{
The original description of constructing turning points proposed dividing
water years into 5-day increments and selecting the minimum flow for each period.
Gustard and others (1992) describe using continuous 5-day increments rather than restarting
on the water year.

# Process by calendar year as that is the retrieval range
ChopBFI <- with(ChoptankFlow, bfi(date, discharge, by="calendar year",
STAID="01491000"))
